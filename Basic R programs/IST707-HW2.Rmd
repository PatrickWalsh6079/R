## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Requires tidyverse package


```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

storyteller<- read_csv("C:/Users/Patrick/Syracuse_courses/IST_707/week_3/data-storyteller.csv", na = c(""))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
str(storyteller)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
storyteller$School<-factor(storyteller$School)

#The section column is of the Numeric type and should be be a factor instead

storyteller$Section<-factor(storyteller$Section)

#Each of the remaining columns is a discrete count of the students in each category.
#As it is not continuous the columns 'Very Ahead', 'Middling', 'Behind', 'More behind', 'Very behind'
#and 'Completed' should all be integers.

storyteller$`Very Ahead +5`<-as.integer(storyteller$`Very Ahead +5`)
storyteller$`Middling +0`<-as.integer(storyteller$`Middling +0`)
storyteller$`Behind -1-5`<-as.integer(storyteller$`Behind -1-5`)
storyteller$`More Behind -6-10`<-as.integer(storyteller$`More Behind -6-10`)
storyteller$`Very Behind -11`<-as.integer(storyteller$`Very Behind -11`)
storyteller$Completed<-as.integer(storyteller$Completed)
```


```{r}
